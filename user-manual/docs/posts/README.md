# Posts

There are five categories of posts, each category is related to different pages. These pages typically contain a list or group of the posts with the relevant category. The categories are:

`headline` posts are displayed in the top left section of the [home page](https://www.nimbusdance.org)
  
`visual-arts` posts are displayed as images in the visual arts slider on the [nimbus-arts-center page](https://www.nimbusdance.org/nimbus-arts-center/)

`community-projects` posts are linked to within the [outreach page](https://www.nimbusdance.org/outreach/)

`scholarship` is the category of a single post containing the scholarship pledge, the [outreach page](https://www.nimbusdance.org/outreach/) automatically links to this content

`sponsor` posts are shown as logo images at the bottom of the [support page](https://www.nimbusdance.org/support/)

## Creating & editing

To add posts, you can use the standard process which is documented by WordPress here: [wordpress.org/support/article/wordpress-editor](https://wordpress.org/support/article/wordpress-editor/).

## Adding a post to a menu

To add a new post to any of the menus, following the process for [adding menu items](../menus/#changing-menu-items).

## Changing the logo colour

By default, the logo colour is green. If you want the logo in a different colour for a specific post, you can choose another image. Go to the editor for the relevant post, then on the right sidebar click "Add image" under the "Logo" section. 

<img src="../images/logo-colour.png" alt="Logo" width="200" />

Please note, the image you use should be in "png" format and should be the vertical Nimbus logo with a transparent background and the text in any colour. If you don't choose an image, the default green logo is used.
