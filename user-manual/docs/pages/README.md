# Pages

Text content and links on [the support page](https://www.nimbusdance.org/support/) and [school of Nimbus page](https://www.nimbusdance.org/school-of-nimbus/) can be changed using custom fields. Simply open the page editor for those pages and edit the relevant content:

<img src="./support.png" alt="Logo" width="400" />

The following pages cannot currently be changed by a Wordpress admin due to their highly customised and unique styling. Any changes to these need to be requested through a developer for now. In future, this will be changed so that content is editable within WordPress.

- [Home](https://www.nimbusdance.org/) 
- [About](https://www.nimbusdance.org/about/)
- [Nimbus Arts Center](https://www.nimbusdance.org/nimbus-arts-center/)
- [Outreach](https://www.nimbusdance.org/outreach/)

## Other pages
All pages except for the pages listed above can be added/edited/deleted easily via WordPress using the standard WordPress procedure, detailed below.

### Creating & editing

To add/edit pages, you can use the standard process which is documented by WordPress here: [wordpress.org/support/article/pages](https://wordpress.org/support/article/pages/).

## Adding a page to a menu

To add a new page to any of the menus, following the process for [adding menu items](../menus/#changing-menu-items).

## Changing the logo colour

By default, the logo colour is green. If you want the logo in a different colour for a specific page, you can choose another image. Go to the editor for the relevant page, then on the right sidebar click "Add image" under the "Logo" section. 

<img src="../images/logo-colour.png" alt="Logo" width="200" />

Please note, the image you use should be in "png" format and should be the vertical Nimbus logo with a transparent background and the text in any colour. If you don't choose an image, the default green logo is used.
