# Pages

The following six pages cannot currently be changed by a Wordpress admin due to their highly customised and unique styling. Any changes to these need to be requested through a developer for now. In future, this can potentially be changed so that content will be editable within WordPress.

- [Home](https://www.nimbusdance.org/) 
- [About](https://www.nimbusdance.org/about/)
- [Nimbus Arts Center](https://www.nimbusdance.org/nimbus-arts-center/)
- [Support](https://www.nimbusdance.org/support/)
- [School of Nimbus](https://www.nimbusdance.org/school-of-nimbus/)
- [Outreach](https://www.nimbusdance.org/outreach/)
