# Menus

There are three menu areas on the site:
- Main navigation 
- Footer menus for desktop
- Simplified footer menu for mobile
  
## Main navigation menu

This is the main menu running across the top of the website. Its appearance changes for mobile devices to maintain usability.

## Footer menus - mobile

A very simplified version of the desktop footer links - just the main pages.

## Changing menu items

The process is the same to change the links in all of the menus mentioned above: 
Go to "Appearance", "Menus"

<img src="./appearance.png" alt="Appearance Menus" width="200" />

Select which menu you want to edit and click on "select":

<img src="./menu-select.png" alt="Select Menu" width="350" />

On the left hand side, select which page/post you want to add, then press "add to menu"

<img src="./add-to-menu.png" alt="Add to Menu" width="350" />

The menu item will be added to the right (at the bottom) - you can then drag it to wherever you want it to appear.
